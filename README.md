# City Network - Code of Conduct   

## Foreword   

Welcome to the updated Code of conduct for 2021. This is an annual thing so the time is here for a new Code of conduct signing.

What has changed from 2020?
Most of the content is the same but the way we sign and track the signings have changed. The rule that we need to have a witnessed signature still applies. You are also required to sign this code upon your honor. This is a legal definition not as serious as purgery but still punishable by law. It is called Untrue statement.

### The Swedish Penal Code Chapter 15, On Perjury, False Prosecution and Other Untrue Statements
### Section 10
>"A person who in a written deposition which according to law or statute is made under oath or on one's faith and honour or like affirmation, gives untrue information or withholds the truth, shall, if the act jeopardises proof, be sentenced for untrue affirmation to a fine or imprisonment for at most six months or, if the crime is gross, imprisonment for at most two years. If such action is due to gross carelessness, a sentence to a fine or imprisonment for at most six months shall be imposed for careless affirmation."

I have included a direct quote of the legal text regarding Untrue statements.

In order for this to be binding and still be done digital we will use git to sign this Code. The QA-team is responsible for the process of signing this Code and will reach out ot you.  

```

## 1. Background
### Why do we need a Code of conduct?
We as a company are obligated to follow certain codes that regulate our behavior. These codes are derived from various sources, such as contractual agreements from certain customers, as well as strict legal obligations such as GDPR and finally from direct instructions from government authorities. Instead of having multiple different codes for you to read and sign we have gathered all our different obligations under one Code of conduct.

This will be a public document shared with our customers as they shall always be able to verify our conduct against this code.  

``` 



```  

## 2. Replacing all earlier policies
This Code replaces and substitutes all earlier policies and procedures as well as all earlier signed agreements to the extent that should there be a conflict with earlier agreements and this Code, this Code has precedence.   

``` 



```  

## 3. Who Must Follow Our Code?
This is a base document for all representatives of City Network International AB. Representatives are all employees, potential suppliers, partners, sub-contractors and board members acting on behalf of City Network or its affiliates. All types of representatives are included in the term ‘We’ in this document. 

This Code represents the values of City Network and sets the framework for how we expect you to behave when you are representing City Network. 

You as a representative are always expected to act and behave in a manner that reflects City Network’s core values. 

This code should give you clear guidance on your obligations regarding conduct. It shall also describe the processes should you deviate from code. 

By signing this Code, you agree to adhere to it for a period of 12 months from the signing date. Even if your employment or affiliation with City Network International AB has ended before then. 

This Code shall be updated and re-approved and resigned by all representatives at least every 12 months.  

``` 



```  

## 4. Goals with this Code
The goal with this Code is first and foremost to protect all employees from any legal or financial accountabilities in case of a breach or deviation. Strict adherence to this Code will free employees from any and all accountability. If you have acted within this Code, City Network will protect you against all claims and liabilities that may result from a breach.

## 8. Zero tolerance behavior
Certain behaviors and conducts are in direct conflict with the values of City Network and should never be tolerated. This is true for all including customers and suppliers as well as representatives. The following list is specific areas where City Network has a pledge never to in any way contribute to the profit of such behavior. This includes the services we provide to our customers as well as the products and services we purchase from our suppliers. As a representative, you have an obligation to immediately report any suspicion of deviations from our zero-tolerance. This might be simple things as changing the type of coffee we purchase to our office, to complicated things such as one of our customers using our services for malicious purposes.

We shall actively strive to ensure that City Network in no way contributes to Child labor.

### 8.2. Corruption

You respect my boundaries, and when you’re not clear about what’s okay and not okay, you ask. You’re willing to say no.

## 10. Conduct on becoming a representative of City Network
You are always expected to act in a responsible and dignified manner in all situations where you represent City Network. 

Ask yourself: Can this action be perceived as contrary to City Network’s core values? If the answer is yes, or you are unsure, then take another action.

The nature of our business makes the trust of our customers our most valued asset. All actions we do should strive to increase the trust of our customers.

### 10.1. We practice equal opportunity employment
Employment at City Network is solely based on your individual qualifications and merits in regards to your professional competence. We do not tolerate any type of discrimination or harassment based upon race, religion, nationality, gender identity or expression, pregnancy status, sexual orientation, medical conditions or disabilities. We will take all reasonable actions to meet all legal obligations for safeguarding the rights of the disabled.

### 10.2. We respect the law
We follow local laws and customs to the fullest extent we can without violating the individual human rights set by EU law. If you are convicted of a felony it is considered to be a direct breach of this code. A felony means crimes that carry a potential prison sentence.

### 10.3. We respect intellectual property rights
We shall always strive to ensure that we pay appropriate license fees for intellectual property rights in all cases where we do not use open-source software. We shall not breach fair use standards set by any open source or proprietary suppliers.

### 10.4. We do not tolerate harassment, discrimination or bullying
Any form of harassment, discrimination or bullying regardless if it is verbal, physical, digital or visual is prohibited.

### 10.5. Drugs and alcohol
We believe that substance abuse is contrary to the safety of our employees and our customers and is not tolerated. Consumption of alcohol at the workspace is not prohibited, but you are expected to practice good judgment. Intoxication is never a valid excuse for breaching this Code, impaired professional performance when on duty or otherwise inappropriate behavior. Never have any direct customer contact, where you are expected to provide a professional service such as support or consulting, while intoxicated.

``` 



```

## 11. Confidentiality
The sheer nature of our business is based on customers trusting us with the custody of their data. This trust can easily be tarnished if we have even an appearance of not keeping the customer's data confidential.

First, try and avoid interacting with the information owned and operated by the customer directly. Just interact through the mechanism of providing infrastructure. We provide a highway but do not bother what is in the trucks that traffic our highway. It is however inevitable that you may pick up information about our customers over time. Remember that any information that is generated by a customer or information about a customer should be handled with the utmost of care.

Customer-related information is always confidential and should be handled accordingly. Regardless of how you come by the information, be it that you overheard something or if you mistakenly were exposed to the information you should never disclose the information outside City Network.

### 11.1. Obligation survives employment and affiliation
You are obligated to ensure that you never disclose confidential information to unauthorized parties. This obligation survives your employment or affiliation with City Network indefinitely. You may never disclose any information belonging to a customer to a third party ever. The only exemptions to this obligation are listed below.

### 11.2. Exempted information
Your obligation not to disclose the information does not apply if:
1. You have received permission from the legal and rightful owner of the information to disclose it.
2. The information is in the public domain and generally available.
3. You can demonstrate that you were in possession of the information before your affiliation with City Network.
4. You can demonstrate that you received the information from an outside party and in no way related to your affiliation with City Network.
5. If you are required by law to disclose the information.

```

## 12. Avoid conflicts of interest
When you are in a situation in which competing loyalties could cause you to pursue a personal benefit for you, your friends, or your family at the expense of City Network or our customers, you may be faced with a conflict of interest. All of us should avoid conflicts of interest as well as the appearance of conflicts.

When considering a course of action, ask yourself whether the action you’re considering could create an incentive for you, or appear to others to create an incentive for you, to benefit yourself, your friends or family, or an associated business at the expense of City Network. If the answer is “yes,” you should avoid that cause of action since it most probably will be a conflict of interest. 

If you are considering entering into a business situation that creates a conflict of interest, then do not. If you are in a business situation that may create a conflict of interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest, make sure you seek outside guidance from your manager or the compliance team. It is important to understand that as circumstances change, a situation that previously did not present a conflict of interest may present one.

The best approach under all circumstances is to be open and transparent with all your interests outside of your employment or affiliation with City Network.

### 12.1. Personal investments
If you have outside investments in companies that have a relation to City Network. Be it a competitor, partner, customer or supplier. Make sure you discuss this with your manager or the compliance team to determine if there is a conflict of interest.

### 12.2. Outside employment, advisory roles, board seats, and starting
your own business
Make sure to be open and transparent with any outside employment or any type of outside activities that pays you money. If you are thinking of starting your own company make sure you discuss it with your manager or the compliance team first.

### 12.3. Business opportunities found through work
Remember that all business opportunities found through work belong to City Network. Should you want to pursue the opportunities for yourself make sure to discuss this with the compliance team and come to a mutually acceptable agreement with City Network before pursuing business opportunities outside of work.

### 12.4. Ideas, inventions, and intellectual property
All ideas, inventions or intellectual property such as software that you create during work is the property of City Network. This is the trade you do for your salary. If you feel that you have good ideas that fall outside of your work assignments, or you have developed things outside of work that you feel could be beneficial for City Network, discuss this with the compliance team or your manager and we can reach a beneficial solution.

### 12.5. Friends and relatives; co-worker relationships
Avoid participating in the management of or decision-making regarding potential or existing business relationships that involve your relatives, spouse or significant other, or close friends. This includes being the hiring manager for a position for which your relative or close friend is being considered or handling the relationship for a company associated with your spouse or significant other.

To be clear, just because a relative, spouse/significant other, or close friend works at City Network or becomes a City Network competitor or business partner doesn’t mean there is a conflict of interest. However, if you are also involved in business decisions that directly affects that individual, it can be very sensitive. The right thing to do in that situation is to discuss the relationship with your manager and the compliance team.

Finally, romantic relationships between co-workers can, depending on the roles and positions of the co-workers involved, create an actual or apparent conflict of interest. If a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict, it may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved.

### 12.6. Accepting gifts, entertainment, and other business courtesies
Accepting gifts, entertainment, and other business courtesies from a party that has a business relation with City Network, be it partner, supplier, customer or competitor, can easily create the appearance of a conflict of interest, especially if the value of the item is significant.

Inexpensive, valued less than 20 EUR, non-cash gifts are as well as infrequent business meals, entertainment with clients and invitations to local events considered ok. If you accept a gift make sure it is perceived as what is considered appropriate for normal business relations.

### 12.7. Use of City Network services and equipment
We encourage our staff to use and experiment with our own services but you should take care when providing discounts for friends and family. If you use our services in a manner that provides financial benefits to either yourself or friends and family you should discuss this with your manager or the compliance team.

## 13. Privacy and the rights of the Subjects according
to GDPR

### 13.1. Obligations as a data processor
City Network as an infrastructure provider always functions as a processor in regards to the processing of personal data where the customer is the controller. Make sure never to interact with individual records of personal data that is controlled by the customer. 

Always interact with customer-controlled data at an infrastructure level. Never view or read data that is stored inside the customer's virtual environment unless specially instructed to do so by the customer.

As a supplier of infrastructure, our main responsibility in regards to data processing is to meet the technical and organizational security measures set by GDPR. This is done by following the security goals set by ENISA.

### 13.2. ENISA Cybersecurity goals
1. protecting data against accidental or unauthorized storage, processing, access, disclosure, destruction, loss, or alteration,
2. ensuring that only authorized persons, programs, and machines can access the protected
data,
3. recording any transactions related to the protected data,
4. making sure that any data transactions can be inspected,
5. recovering data in case of information security events, and
6. requiring that ICT products and services are provided on the basis of secure software applications.

## 14. Follow the set policies and procedures
Outside of this Code, you will be presented with various different policies and procedures. All relevant policies and procedures will be presented in the wiki as links ti Git repositories and will have an extra “I have read and understood” procedure connected to each individual policy. 

Policies will be presented to you based on your role within the company and procedures may differ from one role to another so always make sure you know what is expected of you specifically. Git repositories labeled “policy” and have the “I have read and understood” attachment is considered part of this Code. 

The reason for this is to ensure that we do not present unnecessary burdensome policies for roles that really do not require that. Finance and marketing have little need for reading and understanding our cryptographic key policy. It is the responsibility of City Network management to ensure that each individual is presented with the appropriate set of policies based on their role. If you change role within City Network so will the set of policies you will have to read and consume.

Deviations from the policies are considered a breach of this code and will face the same consequences and procedures. It is of the utmost importance that you actually read and understand the policies presented to you. Make sure you rather ask one time too many than too few.

``` 



```

## 15. Consequences of deviation from this Code
First, if you are not an employee of City Network deviation from this code is considered a fundamental breach of contract and shall be handled accordingly. This may include termination of contracts as well as claims for damages. 

For employees of City Network the potential consequences may include one or more of\:  

* Verbal warning
* Written warning
* Change of user rights
* Change of work orders and authorities
* Reduction of benefits
* Deduction of pay
* Dismissal or Termination of employment
* Civil lawsuit and prosecutions
* Criminal lawsuits and prosecutions

Even accidental and unintentional deviations from this code may have negative consequences for you. New laws like GDPR is very unforgiving in that regard so make sure you follow the policies and procedures. It is never wrong to ask for help. We shall encourage collaboration and cooperation.

``` 



```

## 16. The process of determining a consequence from a deviation
If there is a report of a potential deviation from this code, senior management will assign an investigator the task of gathering all the facts and present them in a deviation report to senior management. Should senior management find that you have deviated from this code they will call you to a meeting and you will be allowed to present your version of the events. You are allowed to bring outside counsel such as a friend, union representative or other counsel to the meeting. Remember that if you want outside counsel that is not an employee at City Network, they may have to sign a confidentiality agreement. You will not be compensated by City Network if your counsel demands a monetary fee for your representation.

After you have been allowed to present your case senior management will deliberate and notify you of their ruling and potential consequences for you. You shall be informed of this ruling no later than 72 hours after your meeting.

In cases where the consequences to you is more severe than a warning, you have the right to request that your case be presented before a disciplinary committee. The disciplinary committee shall consist of at least 3 individuals and special care shall be taken to ensure that all individuals are as neutral as possible in regards to you. Special care shall also be taken to ensure that the members of the disciplinary committee have the competence to analyze the case and its merits. If the situation warrants it senior management may bring in external legal expertise to serve as a member of the disciplinary committee.

The disciplinary committee will schedule a hearing where a representative from City Network and you will make separate presentations before the committee and answer questions from the committee. You are allowed to bring outside counsel such as a friend, union representative or other counsel to the hearing. Remember that if you want outside counsel that is not an employee at City Network, they may have to sign a confidentiality agreement. You will not be compensated by City Network if your counsel demands a monetary fee for your representation.

After presentations and questions before the committee, the committee will immediately deliberate and make a ruling. The ruling of the committee will be final in terms of internal processes at City Network. Should either party be unhappy with the ruling of the committee they may seek to handle it as a dispute to this code.

``` 



```

## 17. Disputes to this Code of conduct
